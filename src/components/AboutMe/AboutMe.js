                If you came across this portfolio, you are probably looking for a developer, and you are in the right place.<br></br>
                Before I tell you about my work, let me tell you my story.
                I'm wos born and raised in Severodonetsk, it was average size city in estern part of Ukraine.
                Programming has been my interest since high school.
                I remember we were choosing an extra subject to study  and I was the only one who chose informatics.
                Those were the best years at my school. It was really magecale for me to be able to create something from nothing.
                The first program that I built was a calculator and it was created with Delphi. After high school, my relatives insisted on going to a specific
                University and studying Aircraft Technology engineering, even though I knew that this was not what I wanted to do, I could not go against my family.
                After two years of studying I was going to switch my majors to Computer Science, but at that time I got a chance to come to the United States. And took this opportunity.
                After arriving in the United States, I was forced to adapt really quickly to a new environment.
                I did not speak or understand English, but I was alone here so I had to learn how to survive and provide for myself.
                I found a job really fast , it was not the greatest , but I was able to pay for my school and all my billes. And then I was working and living an average life without ambitions, until my Mother got sick and we had to take measures right away. So I got 2 extra jobs.
                I was working 16-18 hours a day. After three years of this dynamic, my Mother got better, and I was able to get back to normal life. But I realized that I do not want to go back, and I have to find something that I'm passionate about.
                I did try a lot of different paths but nothing was making me happy.
                Until I got to know one person, that person was developing a game , and it got my attention.
                I asked a couple of times to show me his work and explain what he was doing , of course he did , and I was not able to understand what he was talking about, but I still was very  curious.
                So I did some studying on my own, just for fun. I read some books  and followed tutorials, and I came to realize that this is more than a hobby for me.
                That's how I came to study at App Academy for Software Engineering.
                It was a wonderful experience , not going to lie.
                It was intense and you have to do a lot of research if you want to go deeper into the subject, but they did walk me through this path, and teach me how to become a developer.
                As of right now I still have a long way to go.
                But I am capable of building full stuck applications on my own and with the team. Currently i comfortable with React, JavaScript, React, Redux and many ather technologies, check out my projects  <a href="/projects">My Projects </a>
